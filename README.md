# rusty-riscy

rusty-riscy is a performance testing and system resource monitoring tool written in Rust to benchmark RISC-V processors. 

## Objectives

- To create a lightweight but highly functional tool to safely stress test CPUs and (potential) memory and GPUs too.
- To use as few third-party dependencies as possible to achieve the same.

**This tool is under development and is not advised to be used on anything but a virtual machine. The repository owner is not responsible for any damage caused to your machines**
